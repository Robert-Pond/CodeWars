# CodeWars
 I have a total of 54 solves on CodeWars as of writing this. 
 
 Most of which are very basic getting back in the swing of things or used for demonstration purposes while teaching others how to work through a problem.
 
 The 5 problems I have here are those that were most difficult and I feel best show my capabilities. 
 They are by no means perfect and lack good or really any documentation for the most part.
 However they are a good representation of the level of problem Ive been able to solve without resorting to outside resourses.
 
 Codewars as a whole is also not a fan of posting solves to their problems publicly, against the code of conduct and all that.
 SO only posting a few seemed like the better route.
